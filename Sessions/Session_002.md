# Session Live Notes

- The party starts stuck on a boat and we see a serpent in the sky

- The ocean is still and the current is moving us forward
- Check the compass and see that we're going in the right direction

    - The ship does start to progress out of the storm
    - We leave the storm and make it back to the village at night
    - We're back in the batbaryan
- We talk to the captain tete wawa and try to seduce him but it's not super romantic
    - We get him to tell us about the serpent instead
    - There's spirits better than us out there
    - **The Great Iron Snake** Puthawan is the island
    - The great aramona ridge and they struck the Snake
        - The snake felt regret so it allowed ancestors to come back to the city every year
        - In about a month during prayers and offerings people come to grieve with their ancestors
- Storm on puthawaran over the last month
- We meet up with Datu
    - He's excited to see we brought the weapon back for him
    - We tell him that we're not going to give him the weapon until he gives us the gold
    - Someone comes out and is writing down something on a copper plate
    - Tito cling cling chimes in and says the plate is as good as gold

    - Babaylan Dalisay
    - As she walks in, a big fat white snake follows her in with red eyes
    - Babaylan is a spiritual leader for this area
    - Datu is more like a day to day runner, she's the emotional spirit leader of agusan
    - Nat 20 Persuasion check by Mordrith asking Babaylan about why Datu wanted us to steal the weapon
        - Sad music plays
        - The spirits here they're strong they reflect everything... from the smallest rock to the biggest mountain. Spirits exist. And the bigger they are the scarier they are. But we ... just persist... that's the true strength of us. We work together, we put up the planks that are missing, and we fill them together. We drown out the water, and we work together. You shouldn't fear the spirits, they just exist - like you or I, should i have died 75 years ago, like my mother. I exist right now

            - Elyra shows her the letter that Elandi wrote to her, and it looks like the script of the local language but it doesn't make any sense
            - Sina una is a misconception - people say these are the islands of sina una, but they're all individual - no one say's they're sina unan's. Sina una means those who came first. The people who live here are able to celebrate and connect with their ancestors
