- We see some people we know, and some we don't
- Antonius' dad is in the back of the bar chilling like the godfather
- Mordrith is invisible and Elyra is disuised as Elandi
- Elyra disguised as Elandi get's recognized immediately
- Elyra convinces the hostess that she just wants to have a low key night and have a drink with her friends
- Elyra goes over to the bar and orders a drink from Tony with Kirea on her shoulder as a fly, and mordrith
- He asks Elyra if she's here on business
- She lies and says she's there for a message
    - He says oh Big Birdbrain want's a message?
    - His boys are on it* 
    - THeyr'e working on the ring
    - He doesn't know if he's going to be able to round up all the troublemakers though

    - The big man said he might need them for the big fight
    - TJM is the boss? Leader of the city for the past few months.

- Tony has got a rapier and a metal crossbow 
- Antonius asks who kills the Mata's and Tony just looks at him and winks
- Antonius gets more serious and grabs him by the collar and says he needs to know who killed Mordrith's parents

- For some reason our party has an obsession with trying to pants people and we try unsuccessfuly to pants Tony which fails
- Kirea flies into Tony's mouth as a fly and then shapeshifts into a caribou in his mouth trying to damage him
