# Live Session Notes

- After narrowly escaping the wrestler encampment, we set our sights on the big city.
- On our journey, we stumbled upon a clearing with some whistling trees and a house.
- The trees were making an odd whistling sound.
- As we approached the house, the trees ambushed us, but our fire magic was too much for them, and we quickly set them ablaze.
- We spared one tree to ensure their magical forest kin would be loyal to us and asked what they were up to.
- They explained they were guarding the house, which we decided to explore.
