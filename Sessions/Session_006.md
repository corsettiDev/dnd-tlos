# Live Session Notes

- WWE Style showdown
- We conquered all challengers before stacking all of the tables and chairs we could find to make a leaning tower to increase our height
- Then we shot tied a rope to a crossbow bolt before Antonius expertly harpooned onto the floating chair
- Elyra scaled the rope to press the button and win the challenge
- Immediately after a Wrestling God dropped from the sky - super powerful
- Champion of the storm
- We also throw the drui we were with under the bus just for fun and then they immediately got murdered LOL
- Batbaryan Came to the village to seek knowledge, and how to fight 
- A man who felt unacknowledged by Batbaryan
- His name is Roman
- He found out there was gold and jewels being paid to local leaders that he thought were being paid for batbaryan to train
- Alfred was pissed that Roman had the gems, Alfred caused the destruction of where the clan lived, now they're a travelling 
- He wants to celebrate us, so then we decide to drug him to try to steal his belt
- We all failed epically at trying to stealth his panths off, and then his security team shows up
- IT'S ELANDI as a badass rogue and another mage
- They teleport everyone away and now we're sitting here lucky to be alive
